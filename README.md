# Python-Movie-Recommender-System-using-SVD

# Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a movie recommender system using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The system will recommend movies to users based on their past ratings and preferences.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Obtain two separate datasets: one containing information about movies (e.g., title, genre, release year) and another containing user ratings for these movies.
Ensure each dataset contains a common identifier (e.g., movie ID) that can be used to join the datasets.
Data Preprocessing:

Merge or join the two datasets based on the common identifier.
Handle missing values, duplicates, and any other data quality issues.
Represent the merged dataset as a matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and the entries represent ratings.
Model Building:

Utilize the SVD algorithm to decompose the rating matrix into three matrices: user features matrix, item (movie) features matrix, and diagonal matrix of singular values.
Determine the number of latent factors (dimensions) to use in the decomposition.
Train the SVD model on the rating matrix using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent or alternating least squares.

# Model Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set using appropriate metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Recommendation Generation:

Once the model is trained and evaluated, use it to generate movie recommendations for users.
For a given user, predict ratings for movies they haven't seen based on their past behavior and preferences.
Recommend movies with the highest predicted ratings that the user hasn't already rated or seen.

# Tools and Technologies Used
* Python: The project is implemented in Python programming language.
* Libraries: Libraries such as pandas,numpy,scikit-surprise,SVD implementation.
* Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE can be used for development.
